# Beer Hawk React Test

In this short test we would like you to demonstrate how you would fetch data from an API and display it in a re-usable component. This folder contains a pre-packaged development environment (courtesy of Create React App). Before you begin, make sure that you have already run the following command in this directory:

npm install

Once you have installed the necessary node modules, run:

npm start

This should open up a live development environment in your default web browser (this will be on localhost port: 3000). Use this live development environment to complete the test.

## The Task

A basic SPA template has been set up to give you a good place to start (it is located in src/App.js) This template includes a simple page with a single search field - what we want is to be able to get product information by entering a SKU code into this field (some example SKU codes are provided in the comments).

Your task is to take any SKU code entered into the search field, use it to make an AJAX call to the "/products" repository of Magento's REST API and neatly display the resulting product data in the space below. The product data should be displayed in a re-usable component that simply shows a few basic details i.e name, image & price.

We want to gain an understanding of your React knowledge in terms of state management / the use of props etc. additionally, we want to see your approach to "re-usability" and how you handle fetching data asynchronously.


# CRA README:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
